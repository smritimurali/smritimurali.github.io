The problem of bufferbloat arises due to the presence of large unmanaged buffers in routers. This leads to high queuing latency and significantly degrades the performance of timesensitive and interactive traffic. AQM mechanisms that aim to address the problem of bufferbloat try to achieve an optimal trade-off between high link utilization and low mean queue length. PIE is a lightweight AQM mechanism that tries to achieve the same. To our knowledge, ns-3 network simulator does not have a model for simulating PIE. Hence, in this paper, we implement a ns-3 model for PIE, and show that the results obtained from it are in line with those obtained from the ns-2 model of PIE, implemented by its authors.","tags":[],"title":"Implementation and Evaluation of Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (PIE) Algorithm in ns-3","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596241744,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596241744,"objectID":"66b706ef6e986095f9d8303306bf4483","permalink":"https://smritimurali.github.io/project/disaster/","publishdate":"2020-07-31T20:29:04-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/disaster/","section":"project","summary":"The aim of the project was to build a crowd sourced platform to be used during a disaster for the aggregation, dissemination and analysis of important information needed for rescue and relief operations.

Immediate processing of data implies there must not be any violation of hard deadlines. Contiki, an OS designed for IoT, does not however provide full support for real-time operations. The scheduler and timer modules of this OS are studied, and we compare the performances of the native scheduling algorithm and purely pre-emptive scheduling of tasks.

In this paper, we examine how Coffee is better than CFS-POSFIX for real-time operations and validate it by running a simulation on Cooja. We further explore Coffee’s prominent features such as garbage collection, wear levelling, etc. We suggest improvements to reduce the unpredictable delays caused by long tasks like file extension and garbage collection.
