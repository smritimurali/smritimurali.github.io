The problem of bufferbloat arises due to the presence of large unmanaged buffers in routers. This leads to high queuing latency and significantly degrades the performance of timesensitive and interactive traffic. AQM mechanisms that aim to address the problem of bufferbloat try to achieve an optimal trade-off between high link utilization and low mean queue length. PIE is a lightweight AQM mechanism that tries to achieve the same. To our knowledge, ns-3 network simulator does not have a model for simulating PIE. Hence, in this paper, we implement a ns-3 model for PIE, and show that the results obtained from it are in line with those obtained from the ns-2 model of PIE, implemented by its authors.","tags":[],"title":"Implementation and Evaluation of Proportional Integral Controller Enhanced (PIE) Algorithm in ns-3","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596241744,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596241744,"objectID":"346afde61b5af43f6e9b313388a349a0","permalink":"https://smritimurali.github.io/project/smriti_is-the_best/","publishdate":"2020-07-31T20:29:04-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/smriti_is-the_best/","section":"project","summary":"Yaaaayyy !! hello world","tags":[],"title":"Smriti_is The_best","type":"project"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1596241694,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1596241694,"objectID":"c636e8036903b3af3febf6ab1875a784","permalink":"https://smritimurali.github.io/project/my-project-name/","publishdate":"2020-07-31T20:28:14-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/my-project-name/","section":"project","summary":"yoooo I created a project","tags":[],"title":"My Project Name","type":"project"},{"authors":["Smriti Murali","V.

Our model aims at providing both an online and offline platform for data aggregation, dissemination and analysis. We propose a three level model which attempts to reduce the impact of the disaster on the victims by providing a platform that helps coordination between all parties involved, and ensures availability of resources and information. We discuss the existing solutions like Ushahidi and try to incorporate successful features into our model. Further, we use various techniques ranging from Natural Language Processing (NLP) to crowd sourcing, and ensure a robust, scalable solution which can be used by all the parties involved.","tags":[],"title":"Crowdsourcing for disaster relief: A multi-platform model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["V Krishnapriya","Smriti Murali and K Chandrasekaran"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1457049600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1457049600,"objectID":"ec3a0be778015169ce67f6f4c77abf1f","permalink":"https://smritimurali.github.io/publication/jasso/","publishdate":"2020-07-31T21:35:41-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/jasso/","section":"publication","summary":"The fast-paced nature of data in Internet of Things (IoT) applications demands that the operating systems be able to efficiently schedule tasks with no delays. Immediate processing of data implies there must not be any violation of hard deadlines. Contiki, an OS designed for IoT, does not however provide full support for real-time operations. The scheduler and timer modules of this OS are studied, and we compare the performances of the native scheduling algorithm and purely pre-emptive scheduling of tasks. Experiments are run on Cooja, a simulator provided for Contiki to run on desktop systems. We also take a look at the scheduling algorithms employed by other operating systems employed for IoT.

A real-time application is expected to process data instantly without buffering delays or jitter. Contiki, an open source OS, provides only partial support for such operations. In this paper, we examine how Coffee is better than CFS-POSFIX for real-time operations and validate it by running a simulation on Cooja. We further explore Coffee’s prominent features such as garbage collection, wear levelling, etc. We suggest improvements to reduce the unpredictable delays caused by long tasks like file extension and garbage collection. We then examine how latencies in file operations can be reduced to enhance its real time performance.","tags":[],"title":"Contiki as RTOS A look at Contiki’s Flash File System – Coffee","type":"publication"}]
